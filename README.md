the "reverse_shell.py" script is a **rever shell** which is meant to be executed from victim's machine
once executed the reverse shell then tries to connect to our server, which is implemented in **the_server.py** script,
even if the reverse shell fails to connect to the server, it will retry to connect every 10sec, once executed the reverse shell
copies itself to multiple loactions in the victim's system.
